# Cplusplus-Program
Project 1 
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
THe goal of the project was to provide you the experience of going through the interview process for a Junior Developer position at Chada Tech. This first part of the interview tasked you with print 2 clocks, one that displayed time in a 12 HR format(HH:MM:SS) and a clock in 24 HR format(HH:MM:SS). Then create an interface to allow the user to adjust the time by adding minutes, hours, or seconds. I had to ensure that all of the logic of a clock like if a minute was added to the 12 hour clock 12:59:59 time would need to start at 01:00:00, and so on and so forth for both clocks.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think what I did well was the functions and properly handling most of the logic of the clock, also I think I did the display, and main program for the menu loop very well. I felt pretty good about the math functionality of the clocks as well, I was able to correctly display the time after doing each function (adding a minute, hour, and seconds).

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
A few things I would do to enhance my code would be to make sure that I consider that if the clock is at the 12th, or 23rd hourly that  I properly increment minutes and seconds as well. I did not add that logic in to my code. Also now that I have a more comprehensive understanding of classes and objects I could implement that into the code to make my variables more hidden and secure within the program.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The thing I found most challenging of this code was getting the format to display correctly, I forgot about some things like setw and setfill to ensure that a '0' was added if the hour, minute or second value was less than 10. Resources that helped me were websites like stack overflow, and the zybooks learning activities.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills that are particularly transferable from this project to others would the ability to use pointers and functions in an efficient way to reduce the amount of duplicate code, and code in the main method. I also think the ability to use  modulus for certain types of arithmetic is very useful and very transferable as well to other types of projects or course work that I work on in the future.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program more maintainable and readable by eliminating the amount of the code I used in the main method by using functions for all major parts of the code, the like the display, and the functions to interact with the clock. I think  by using functions this code would be very adaptable and could easily be used in other projects.
